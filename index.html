<!-- looking at my source ,eh?  -->
Hi --- Welcome to my homepage<br><br>
I'm a junior CS/Physics double major at CMU.
<br><br>
If you wanna see my github, it's <a href="http://www.github.com/cpd85">here.</a> <br> <br>
A brief overview of some things I work on can be found <a href="/projects.html">here.</a>
<br><br>I'd say my main interests include making coffee and running and programming. Also pro sports (go 76ers...) but if you wanna see my real interests, take a look at my <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/grendel8594/">reddit account</a>.
