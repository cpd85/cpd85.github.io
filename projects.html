<p>I'm currently toying around with CPython's native interface, trying to create a faster (maybe just for some cases) implementation. 
<a href="https://github.com/cpd85/pyuba">Check it out.</a>
Feel free to contribute! (This project will become more sparsely maintained as my courseload is getting more heavy.)</p>

<p>I've written a dynamic memory allocator, a basic shell for executing processes, and a caching proxy server. Sources can't be attached because they were class projects.</p>
<p>See my <a href="https://github.com/cpd85/">github</a> for various hackathons I've done.</p>
